# Contributing & Community Guidelines

Thanks for taking an interest in the project. This document explains how to interact with the community, create issues, and submit requests so maintainers can respond and triage efficiently.

Be respectful
- Be courteous and assume good intentions.
- Personal attacks, harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory language will not be tolerated.
- Keep language clear, polite, and focused on the issue or idea.

Where to open things
- Bug reports: use the Bug Report template in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md
- Feature requests: use the Feature Request template in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md
- General discussion or suggestions: open an issue and choose an appropriate category, or use any Discussions/Channels the project exposes.

Filing a good issue
- Use the appropriate template.
- Provide a clear title.
- Include steps to reproduce for bugs, or a concrete use-case for feature requests.
- Add environment details where relevant (app version, platform, OS, device).
- Attach screenshots, logs, or short recordings if they help.

Feature requests
- Explain the problem you want solved, not just the solution.
- Describe the scenario and how it would be used.
- If possible, indicate how important it is for you (nice-to-have vs must-have).

What happens after you open an issue
- A maintainer will triage the issue, may ask clarifying questions, and will add labels.
- Issues that require implementation may be copied or transferred to the private/internal issue tracker.
- The maintainers may close duplicate, invalid, or out-of-scope issues with an explanation.

Response times & expectations
- Maintainers are volunteers or a small team; response times vary.
- Triaging and prioritization are done based on impact and roadmap.
- Filing complete, well-documented issues helps speed up responses.

Privacy & sensitive data
- Do NOT post personal or private data in public issues.
- If the issue requires sharing sensitive information to reproduce, ask maintainers how to share it privately.

No code contributions here
- This repository is for tracking and discussion only. The main source code is in a private repository.
- If you have design mockups, API suggestions, or pseudocode, share them in an issue and the maintainers will consider them.

Labels and prioritization
- Issues will be labeled (example: bug, enhancement, discussion, roadmap).
- Labels represent triage status and prioritization; they are not guarantees of implementation.

Closing or transferring issues
- When work is done internally, maintainers will update or close the public issue with a note and, where possible, link to the changelog or release notes.
- Not every issue will result in a change.

Getting help
- If you need help drafting your issue, follow the templates or ask for assistance in an issue titled "Help: drafting issue".
- Be patient and provide updates when asked.

Thank you
- Thanks for reading and for contributing to the conversation. Your feedback helps shape the product.

If you want me to add a Code of Conduct (e.g., Contributor Covenant) and a private contact for enforcement, I can provide that next.
