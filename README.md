# Community Roadmap

Welcome — this repository is the Community Roadmap for the app. It is a community-facing space for users to report bugs, request features, and discuss the direction of the product. The main application repository is private; this repository exists so the community can be involved transparently without exposing proprietary development details.

Why two repositories?
- The main application code and internal development logic are private.
- This public repository lets the community engage, file issues, and influence priorities while protecting proprietary work.
- Issues filed here may be transferred into the project's internal issue tracking system used by the development team.

What this repository is for
- Reporting bugs you encounter while using the app.
- Requesting features or improvements.
- Engaging in discussions about priorities and usability.
- Tracking high-level progress of features, bugfixes, and roadmap items.

What this repository is NOT for
- Submitting pull requests to change the private/main codebase. The main repository is private; code changes will not be accepted here.
- Sharing confidential or sensitive information (see Security below).
- Replacing the official internal issue tracker used by the development team.

How issues are handled
1. Community members create issues using the templates provided (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/).
2. The maintainers review issues and may:
   - Ask for clarification in a comment,
   - Triage and label the issue,
   - Transfer required details into the private/internal issue tracker for implementation.
3. When an issue is moved internally, maintainers will usually leave a comment explaining the transfer and will update the issue status publicly where possible.
4. Not every issue will be implemented. Prioritization depends on impact, feasibility, and the project's roadmap.

Transparency and changelogs
- The goal is to be as transparent as possible about progress and decisions.
- A dedicated changelog website will be published (for non-GitHub users and less technical audiences) showing releases and high-level progress.
- Release notes and major changes will be reflected here and on the changelog site when available.

How you can contribute
- Report bugs using the Bug Report template.
- Request features using the Feature Request template and describe the problem and your suggested solution.
- Participate in discussions politely and constructively.
- Share screenshots, logs, steps to reproduce, or short screencasts to help maintainers triage faster.

Security
- Do NOT include sensitive or private data (private keys, credentials, PII) in public issues.
- If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact the project owner privately. (Provide contact method in a private channel or email; consider adding a private security contact if you want a formal channel.)

Community guidelines and support
- See CONTRIBUTING.md for details on community behavior, how to use issue templates, and discussion etiquette.
- Be respectful, assume good intent, and keep conversations constructive and on-topic.

Contact
- Use this repository to open issues and start discussions.
- For private matters (security, legal), contact the maintainer privately.

Thank you for contributing your time and feedback — your reports and ideas help shape the product!
